Place directories with images to be tested in this 'datasets' directory.

When running the program, just enter the name of the folder and the program will know to look in 'datasets' directory

E.g. if we have a folder named 'tiff-conv1' that has a bunch of tif images,
all we have to enter when the program asks, is 'tiff-conv1'.
There is no need to enter the 'datasets' local path.
